                    In 2000, Johnson published his autobiography, titled The Rock Says..., which he co-wrote with Joe
                    Layden. It debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and remained on the list for several
                    weeks.

                    In 2013, Johnson hosted and produced the TNT reality competition series The Hero. In 2014, he hosted

                    In March 2016, Johnson partnered with American fitness apparel manufacturer Under Armour to release
                    "Project Rock". The first item in his partnership with Under Armour, a gym bag, sold out in a couple of
                    days. His second item, a black T-shirt sporting his signature "Brahma bull", sold out after being worn
                    at WrestleMania 32. Johnson also released an alarm clock app as part of "Project Rock" that received
                    more than one million downloads in its first week of release. Since then, they have released sneakers,
                    headphones, and other apparel.

                    bodybuilding shows such as The Arnold Classic and Joe Weider's Mr. Olympia. The show was set to debut in
                    October 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia, but plans were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <h3>Actor-Producer-Professional Wrestler-Businessman</h3>

                <p>Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name The Rock, is an American
                    actor,
                    businessman, and former professional wrestler. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional
                    wrestlers of all time, he wrestled for WWE for eight years prior to pursuing an acting career. His
                    films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide, making him
                    one
                    of the world's highest-grossing and highest-paid actors.</p>

                <p> Born in the San Francisco Bay Area to a Samoan mother and a Black Nova Scotian father, Johnson
                    played
                    college football at the University of Miami, and won a national championship in 1991. He aspired to
                    a
                    professional career in football, but went undrafted in the 1995 NFL Draft. He signed with the
                    Calgary
                    Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL), but was cut from the team in his first season.
                    Part of
                    the Anoa'i family, Johnson's father Rocky and maternal grandfather Peter Maivia were professional
                    wrestlers,
                    and he secured a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1996. He rose to
                    prominence after developing the gimmick of a charismatic trash-talker and helped usher in the
                    Attitude Era,
                    an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson left WWE in 2004 and returned in
                    2011
                    as a part-time performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019. A 10-time
                    world
                    champion, including the promotion's first of African-American descent, he is also a two-time
                    Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE's
                    sixth
                    Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view
                    (WrestleMania
                    XXVIII) and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's flagship television series (Raw
                    and
                    SmackDown).</p>

                <p> Johnson's first leading role was as the titular character in the sword and sorcery film The Scorpion
                    King
                    (2002). He has since starred in the comedies The Game Plan (2007), Tooth Fairy (2010), and Central
                    Intelligence (2016); the action-adventure films Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012), G.I. Joe:
                    Retaliation (2013), Hercules (2014), and Skyscraper (2018); the science-fiction films San Andreas
                    (2015) and
                    Rampage (2018), and the animated film Moana (2016). His role as Luke Hobbs in the Fast & Furious
                    films,
                    beginning with Fast Five (2011), has helped it become one of the highest-grossing film franchises.
                    Johnson also stars in the Jumanji films, appearing in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) and
                    Jumanji: The
                    Next Level (2019), and is set to portray Black Adam in its superhero film adaptation.</p>

                <p>Johnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series Ballers (2015â€“2019), and stars and
                    produces
                    the autobiographical sitcom Young Rock . In 2000, Johnson released the autobiography The Rock Says,
                    which was a New York Times bestseller. In 2012, he co-founded the entertainment production company

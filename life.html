                    <p>Johnson was born in Hayward, California on May 2, 1972, the son of Ata Johnson (née Maivia; born
                        1948)
                        and former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles; 1944–2020). Growing
                        up,
                        Johnson lived briefly in Grey Lynn in Auckland with his mother's family, where he played rugby
                        and
                        attended Richmond Road Primary School before returning to the U.S.</p>

                <div class="flexbox-item flexbox-item-2">
                    Johnson's father was a Black Nova Scotian, with a small amount of Irish ancestry. His mother is
                    Samoan.
                    His father was part of the first black tag team champions in WWE history, along with Tony Atlas. His
                    mother is the adopted daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a pro wrestler. Johnson's maternal
                    grandmother, Maivia's wife Lia, was the first female pro wrestling promoter, taking over Polynesian
                    Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982, and managing it until 1988. Through his
                    grandfather Maivia, Johnson is considered a non-blood relative to the Anoa'i wrestling family. In
                    2008,
                    Johnson inducted his father and grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.
